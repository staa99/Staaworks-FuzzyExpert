for the expert:
	for a context:
		Define the variables, fuzzysets and rules
		set name of output variable to an existing variable defined up
		
		Create questions
			set name to an existing variable created up
			set user text as text for user to read

				value: number
				leads to other context: boolean (if leads to other context, then name must be the name of the context)

				// IMPLEMENTATION DONE


for the user:
	request context: (repeatable 1)
		choose options for questions in context :-> system chooses mapped values as input for option.name. Users see option.[user text]
		pass to system to work on and get a value for the output variable
		the value for the output variable is then compared with the values in output definition
		the result selected from output definition returns a text that is displayed to the user if it does not lead to another context, if it does then do (repeatable 1) ie request context, if no result is found, The text "I'm sorry, I can't help you" is displayed to the user.



for the system:
	to create context:
		provide input method for declarations
		provide input method for questions stored in the format described for expert entry
